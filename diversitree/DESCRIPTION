Description: Contains a number of comparative phylogenetic methods,
  mostly focussing on analysing diversification and character
  evolution.  Contains implementations of BiSSE (Binary State
  Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al. 2007: Syst. Biol. 56:
  701) and its unresolved tree extensions (FitzJohn et al. 2009:
  Syst. Biol. 58: 595), MuSSE (Multiple State Speciation and
  Extinction), QuaSSE (Quantitative State Speciation and Extinction;
  FitzJohn 2010: Syst. Biol. in press), and GeoSSE (Geographic State
  Speciation and Extinction; Goldberg et al. 2010: Syst. Biol.).
  Other included methods include Markov models of discrete and
  continuous trait evolution and constant rate speciation and
  extinction.
