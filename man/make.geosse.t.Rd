\title{Geographic State Speciation and Extinction Model: Time Dependent
  Models}

\description{Prepare to run time dependent GeoSSE (Geographic State
  Speciation and Extinction) on a phylogenetic tree and character
  distribution. This function creates a likelihood function that can be
  used in \link[=find.mle]{maximum likelihood} or \link[=mcmc]{Bayesian}
  inference.}

\usage{
make.geosse.t(tree, states, functions, sampling.f=NULL, strict=TRUE,
              control=list(), truncate=FALSE, spline.data=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree, in \code{ape} \dQuote{phylo} format.}
  
  \item{states}{A vector of character states, each of which must be 0
    (in both regions/widespread; AB), 1 or 2 (endemic to one region; A or
    B), or \code{NA} if the state is unknown.  This vector must have names
    that correspond to the tip labels in the phylogenetic tree
    (\code{tree$tip.label}).}
    
  \item{functions}{A named character vector of functions of time.  See
    details.}

  \item{sampling.f}{Vector of length 3 with the estimated proportion of
    extant species in states 0, 1 and 2 that are included in the
    phylogeny.  A value of \code{c(0.5, 0.75, 1)} means that half of
    species in state 0, three quarters of species in state 1, and all the
    species in state 2 are included in the phylogeny.  By default all
    species are assumed to be known.}
 
  \item{strict}{The \code{states} vector is always checked to make sure
    that the values are 0, 1 and 2 only. If \code{strict} is \code{TRUE}
    (the default), then the additional check is made that \emph{every}
    state is present.  The likelihood models tend to be poorly behaved
    where states are missing.}

  \item{control}{List of control parameters for the ODE solver.  See
    details in \code{\link{make.bisse}}.}
  
  \item{truncate}{Logical, indicating if functions should be truncated
    to zero when negative (rather than causing an error).  May be
    scalar (applying to all functions) or a vector (of length 7).}

  \item{spline.data}{List of data for spline-based time functions.  See
    details in \code{\link{make.bisse.t}}}.
}

\details{
  Please see \code{\link{make.bisse.t}} for further details.

  \code{make.geosse.t} returns a function of class \code{geosse.t}. 
  
  The \code{funtions} is a vector of named functions of time.  For
  example, to have speciation rates be linear functions of time, while
  the extinction and dispersal rates be constant with respect to time,
  one can do \preformatted{functions=rep(c("linear.t", "constant.t"),
  c(3, 4))}.  The functions here must have \code{t} as their first
  argument, interpreted as time back from the present.  See
  \code{\link{make.bisse.t}} for more information, and for some
  potentially useful time functions.
  
  The function has argument list (and default values):

  \preformatted{
    f(pars, condition.surv=FALSE, root=ROOT.OBS, root.p=NULL,
      intermediates=FALSE)
  }
  
  The parameter vector pars is ordered \code{sA}, \code{sB}, \code{sAB},
  \code{xA}, \code{xB}, \code{dA}, \code{dB}. Unresolved clade methods
  are not available for GeoSSE. With three states, it would rapidly
  become computationally infeasible.  The arguments of this function are
  also explained in \code{\link{make.bisse}}.
  
  \code{starting.point.geosse} produces a first-guess set of parameters,
  ignoring character states.

  \code{\link{constrain}} for making submodels and reduce number
  of parameters, \code{\link{find.mle}} for ML parameter estimation,
  \code{\link{mcmc}} for MCMC integration, \code{\link{make.bisse}} and
  \code{\link{make.bisse.t}} for further relevant examples.

  The help page for \code{\link{find.mle}} has further examples of ML
  searches on full and constrained BiSSE models.  Things work similarly
  for GeoSSE and GeoSSE.t, just with different parameters.

  See \code{\link{make.geosse}} for explanation of the base model.
