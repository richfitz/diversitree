\title{Mk2 and Mk-n Models of character evolution}

\description{Prepare to run a Mk2/Mk-n model on a phylogenetic tree and
  binary/discrete trait data.  This fits the Pagel 1994 model,
  duplicating the \code{ace} function in ape.  Differences with that
  function include (1) alternative root treatments are possible, (2)
  easier to tweak parameter combinations through
  \code{\link{constrain}}, and (3) run both MCMC and MLE fits to
  parameters.  Rather than exponentiate the Q matrix, this
  implementation solves the ODEs that this matrix defines.  This may or
  may not be robust on trees leading to low probabilities.
}

\usage{
make.mk2(tree, states, strict=TRUE, control=list())
make.mkn(tree, states, k, strict=TRUE, control=list())
make.mkn.meristic(tree, states, k, control=list())
}

\arguments{
  % TODO: Drop requirements.
  \item{tree}{An ultrametric bifurcating phylogenetic tree, in
    \code{ape} \dQuote{phylo} format.}
  
  \item{states}{A vector of character states, each of which must be 0 or
    1 for \code{make.mk2} or 1 to \code{k} for \code{make.mkn}.}
  
  \item{k}{Number of states to model.}
  
  \item{strict}{The \code{states} vector is always checked to make sure
    that the values are integers on \code{0:1} (\code{mk2}) or
    \code{1:k} (\code{mkn}).  If \code{strict} is \code{TRUE} (the
    default), then the additional check is made that \emph{every} state
    is present.  The likelihood models tend to be poorly behaved where
    states are missing, but there are cases (missing intermediate states
    for meristic characters) where allowing such models may be useful.}
  
  \item{control}{List of control parameters for the ODE solver.  See
    Details below.}
}

\details{
  \code{make.mk2} and \code{make.mkn} return functions of class \code{mkn}.
  These functions have argument list (and default values)
  \preformatted{
    f(pars, pars, prior=NULL, root=ROOT.OBS, root.p=NULL, fail.value=NULL)
  }
  
  The arguments are interpreted as
  \itemize{
    \item \code{pars} For \code{make.mk2}, a vector of two parameters,
    in the order \code{q01}, \code{q10}.  For \code{make.mkn}, a
    vector of \code{k(k-1)} parameters, in the order
    \code{q12,q13,...q1k, q21,q23,...,q2k,...qk(k-1)}, corresponding
    to the off-diagonal elements of the \code{Q} matrix in row order.
    The order of parameters can be seen by running
    \code{\link{argnames}(f)}.
    
    \item \code{prior}: a valid prior.  See \code{\link{make.prior}} for
    more information.
    
    \item \code{root}: Behaviour at the root (see Maddison et al. 2007,
    FitzJohn et al. 2009).  The possible options are
    \itemize{
      \item \code{ROOT.FLAT}: A flat prior, weighting all variables
      equally.
      \item \code{ROOT.EQUI}: Use the equilibrium distribution
      of the model (not yet implemented).
      \item \code{ROOT.OBS}: Weight \eqn{D_0}{D0} and
      \eqn{D_1}{D1} by their relative probability of observing the
      data, following FitzJohn et al. 2009:
      \deqn{D = \sum_i D_i \frac{D_i}{\sum_j D_j}}{
	D = sum_i D_i * (D_i / (sum_j D_j))}
      \item \code{ROOT.GIVEN}: Root will be in state i
      with probability \code{root.p[i]}.
      \item \code{ROOT.BOTH}: Don't do anything at the root,
      and return both values.  (Note that this will not give you a
      likelihood for use with ML or MCMC functions!).
    }
    \item \code{root.p}: Vector of probabilities/weights to use when
      \code{ROOT.GIVEN} is specified.  Must be of length \code{k} (2 for
      \code{make.mk2}).
    
    % TODO: Undocumented:
    \item \code{intermediates}: Add intermediates to the returned value as
    attributes.  Currently undocumented.
  }

  With more than 9 states, qij can be ambiguous (e.g. is q113 1->13 or
  11->3?).  To avoid this, the numbers are zero padded (so that the
  above would be q0113 or q1103 for 1->13 and 11->3 respectively).  It
  might be easier to rename the arguments in practice though.

  The \code{control} argument controls how the calculations will be
  carried out.  It is a list, which may contain elements in
  \code{\link{make.bisse}}.  In addition, the list element \code{method}
  may be present, which selects between three different ways of
  computing the likelihood:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{method="exp"}: Uses a matrix exponentiation approach,
    where all transition probabilities are computed (i.e., for a rate
    matrix \eqn{Q} and time interval \eqn{t}, it computes \eqn{P =
      exp(Qt)}).

    \item \code{method="mk2"}: As for \code{exp}, but for 2 states only.
    Faster, direct, calculations are available here, rather than
    numerically computing the exponentiation.

    \item \code{method="ode"}: Uses an ODE-based approach to compute
    only the \eqn{k} variables over time, rather than the \eqn{k^2}
    transition probabilities in the \code{exp} approach.  This will be
    much more efficient when \code{k} is large.
  }
}

\seealso{
  \code{\link{constrain}} for making submodels, \code{\link{find.mle}}
  for ML parameter estimation, \code{\link{mcmc}} for MCMC integration,
  and \code{\link{make.bisse}} for state-dependent birth-death models.
}

\examples{
## Simulate a tree and character distribution.  This is on a birth-death
## tree, with high rates of character evolution and an asymmetry in the
## character transition rates.
pars <- c(.1, .1, .03, .03, .1, .2)
set.seed(3)
phy <- trees(pars, "bisse", max.taxa=25, max.t=Inf, x0=0)[[1]]

## Here is the 25 species tree with the true character history coded.
## Red is state '1', which has twice the character transition rate of
## black (state '0').
h <- history.from.sim.discrete(phy, 0:1)
plot(h, phy)

## Maximum likelihood parameter estimation:
p <- c(.1, .1) # initial parameter guess

\dontrun{
lik <- make.mk2(phy, phy$tip.state)
fit.mk2 <- find.mle(lik, p)
coef(fit.mk2)   # q10 >> q01
logLik(fit.mk2) # -10.9057

## This can also be done using the more general Mk-n.
## This uses an approximation for the likelihood calculations.  make.mkn
## assumes that states are numbered 1, 2, ..., k, so 1 needs to be added
## to the states returned by trees.
lik.mkn <- make.mkn(phy, phy$tip.state + 1, 2)
fit.mkn <- find.mle(lik.mkn, p)
fit.mkn[1:2]

## These are the same (except for the naming of arguments)
all.equal(fit.mkn[-7], fit.mk2[-7], check.attr=FALSE, tolerance=1e-7)

## Equivalence to ape's \link{ace} function:
model <- matrix(c(0, 2, 1, 0), 2)
fit.ape <- ace(phy$tip.state, phy, "discrete", model=model, ip=p)

## To do the comparison, we need to rerun the diversitree version with
## the same root conditions as ape.
fit.mk2 <- find.mle(lik, p, root=ROOT.GIVEN, root.p=c(1,1))

## These are the same to a reasonable degree of accuracy, too (the
## matrix exponentiation is slightly less accurate than the ODE
## solving approach.  The make.mk2 version is exact)
all.equal(fit.ape[c("rates", "loglik")], fit.mk2[1:2],
          check.attributes=FALSE, tolerance=1e-4)

## The ODE calculation method may be useful when there are a large
## number of possible states (say, over 20).
lik.ode <- make.mkn(phy, phy$tip.state + 1, 2,
                    control=list(method="ode"))
fit.ode <- find.mle(lik.ode, p)
fit.ode[1:2]

all.equal(fit.ode[-7], fit.mkn[-7], tolerance=1e-7)
}
